# React & Next.js Best Practices for Saffari-Raahi Project

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates)
- Export components as named exports, not default exports

## State Management
- Use React hooks (useState, useReducer) for local component state
- Prefer React Query for server state management
- Avoid prop drilling by using context or state management libraries
- Keep state as close as possible to where it's used

## Performance
- Use React.memo for expensive components that render often
- Implement useMemo and useCallback for optimizing renders
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized images

## Routing
- Use Next.js App Router conventions
- Implement proper loading and error states for routes
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Keep page components clean by moving logic to custom hooks

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistent spacing and color schemes
- Use CSS variables for theming

## Data Fetching
- Use React Query for data fetching and caching
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Use Next.js API routes for backend functionality
- Handle API errors gracefully

## Forms
- Validate user input both client and server side
- Provide clear feedback for form errors
- Use controlled components for form inputs
- Implement proper form submission handling

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure proper keyboard navigation
- Include proper ARIA attributes
- Maintain sufficient color contrast

## Code Quality
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Write unit tests for critical components
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Document complex logic with comments

## Project Structure
- Follow Next.js App Router directory structure
- Group related files in feature-based directories
- Use barrel files (index.ts) for clean imports
- Keep configuration files at the root level
